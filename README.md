ZfcUserAcl *DEPRECATED*
=======================
This module has been deprecated, as ZfcAcl has not been actively maintained in some months.
For a Zend\Acl solution, I recommend bjyoungblood/BjyAuthorize.

For more information, please see the [ZF-Commons RFC](https://github.com/ZF-Commons/RFC/issues/1)
